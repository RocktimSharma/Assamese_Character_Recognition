# Assamese-Handwritten-Character-Recognization

# INTRODUCTION
Handwritten Character recognition is a machine's ability to recognize human written
characters from various sources like paper documents, images, sign boards, etc. It is challenging as
handwritten characters are not perfect, and everyone has different handwriting. But with the
evolvement in technology, handwritten character recognition is now possible with the help of
artificial intelligence. Many applications are developed to recognize handwritten written characters
for various languages.


# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project is developed to recognize Handwritten Assamese Characters. It takes images as
input and recognizes the character present in the image. Deep learning techniques, such as CNN,
activation functions are used to recognize and classify the characters.

# MODEL DESIGN

## DATA COLLECTION

For this project, we need a large number of handwritten images of different Assamese characters.A total of 164062 images of 85 different Assamese Characters were collected. For each character, we have collected around 1800 to 1900 images. All the images contain handwritten or digitally drawn Assamese characters. These 85 characters contain 11 "Soroborno", 41  "Byonjonborno" , 10 digits (0 to 9), and 23 "Juktakkhor".
